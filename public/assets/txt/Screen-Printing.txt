🎨 SCREEN PRINTING

Bold. Durable. Built to Scale.


📌 1. About Screen Printing

At Artistic Embroidery, our screen printing service is where precision meets power. With this technique, your design is transferred onto fabric through a carefully created stencil—known as a “screen”—using a finely controlled layer of ink applied by a squeegee. Originally done with silk, today’s screens are made of high-tension nylon or polyester, allowing for incredible accuracy and repeatability.

Screen printing is ideal for bold, high-impact artwork. It delivers vibrant, solid colors with exceptional opacity, meaning your logo or design will pop on any fabric, from soft cotton to rugged polyester blends. We use Pantone color matching to ensure your brand guidelines are respected to perfection.

Whether you’re creating apparel for a corporate campaign, sports team, concert, or nonprofit fundraiser, screen printing offers the visual strength and durability that make your garments stand out.

🔍 Key Benefits:
	•	Bright, vivid colors that don’t fade over time.
	•	Thick ink coverage that creates sharp, clean prints.
	•	Great for bulk orders, thanks to scalable efficiency.
	•	Versatile substrate compatibility (cotton, poly, blends, canvas, etc.).
	•	Flat or curved surfaces, including t-shirts, hoodies, tote bags, and caps.

Want a one-color logo or a full-sized multicolor back design? No problem. With expert screen setup and high-end machines, we produce clean, consistent prints — every time.


🎯 2. Ideal Uses — When Screen Printing Is the Right Choice

Screen printing is not just a method — it’s a strategy. It’s best used when you need long-lasting, eye-catching results, especially across a high volume of pieces.

✅ For Businesses & Brands:
	•	Company logo shirts for staff or trade shows
	•	Promotional giveaways with high visual impact
	•	Custom-branded merchandise for sale

✅ For Teams & Schools:
	•	Team uniforms with bold colors and logos
	•	Spirit wear for students, staff, and fans
	•	Fundraiser apparel with lasting quality

✅ For Events:
	•	T-shirts for marathons, conferences, concerts, or family reunions
	•	Branded apparel for volunteer crews or staff
	•	Bulk shirts for school trips or summer camps

✅ For Marketing & Merch:
	•	Branded hoodies, totes, or hats for customer loyalty campaigns
	•	Band merch and influencer drops
	•	Local business merch that becomes walking advertising

Screen printing is ideal for designs with fewer colors and bold shapes. If your design is highly detailed or photographic, we’ll guide you toward the best print method — including process printing or alternatives like DTF or DTG.


💰 3. What Affects Screen Printing Pricing?

We believe in helping you plan smart. These are the core elements that determine screen printing costs:

👕 Garment Selection

We offer a curated range of apparel at multiple price points: basic, mid-tier, and premium. From soft-touch tees to heavyweight hoodies, your garment choice directly affects both price and print quality.

🔢 Quantity Ordered

Screen printing involves initial setup (screen creation, color separation, alignment). Once set up, the cost per unit decreases significantly with higher quantities, making this the most cost-effective method for bulk orders.

🎯 Number of Print Locations

Each print area — front, back, sleeves, or sides — requires its own screen and setup. A single front print is most economical, while multiple placements will add to the cost.

🌈 Number of Ink Colors

Each color in your design requires a separate screen and run. A single-color print will be the most affordable; two or more colors increase setup time and cost. For highly colorful designs, we may recommend simulated process or digital printing.

📆 Delivery Timeline

Our standard turnaround is optimized for efficiency. Need your order faster? Rush options are available depending on capacity — contact us early so we can prioritize your timeline without compromising quality.
