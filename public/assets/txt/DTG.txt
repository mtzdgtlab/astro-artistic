👕 DTG PRINTING

Unlimited Color. Zero Limits. Full Expression.


📌 1. About DTG Printing

DTG (Direct to Garment) is the most modern form of apparel customization — designed for high-resolution, full-color printing directly onto fabric. Think of it like a high-end inkjet printer for clothing: your artwork is digitally printed right onto the garment, allowing for photo-quality detail, smooth gradients, and vibrant colors.

At Artistic Embroidery, our DTG process is built for precision, softness, and flexibility. We use industry-leading machines and eco-friendly water-based inks that absorb directly into the fibers of the garment — resulting in a breathable, soft-touch print that becomes part of the fabric itself. No heavy layers. No cracking. Just pure, wearable art.

DTG is ideal for intricate or colorful designs with shading, fine lines, and lots of tones — including photographs, gradients, and illustrative artwork.

🖨️ Why DTG?
	•	Unlimited colors — no extra cost for multiple shades or details
	•	Perfect for small runs — no setup fees or minimums
	•	Eco-conscious inks — safe, water-based and vibrant
	•	Soft, breathable feel — no stiffness or texture
	•	Ideal for cotton-based fabrics — especially ringspun or combed cotton

We recommend DTG for any customer looking for quality, speed, and creativity without compromise.


🎯 2. Ideal Uses — When DTG Is the Right Choice

DTG is a favorite among artists, brands, and creators looking to bring their most detailed designs to life. It works especially well when quantity is low but quality must be high.

✅ For Artists, Designers & Merch Brands:
	•	Limited edition drops with rich visuals
	•	Photo-realistic designs with full gradients
	•	Complex logos with subtle details or textures

✅ For Businesses & Startups:
	•	Small-batch branded apparel without investing in large runs
	•	High-color promotional items that make an impression
	•	Quick tests of product-market fit for fashion ideas

✅ For Personalized Apparel:
	•	Photo gifts (birthdays, anniversaries, graduations)
	•	Custom bachelor/bachelorette or party shirts
	•	One-off creative pieces without restrictions

DTG is ideal when:
	•	You have lots of colors or details in your design
	•	You’re ordering a small quantity (even just one)
	•	You need quick production without high setup fees
	•	You want a natural, soft print feel that doesn’t weigh down the shirt

It’s the perfect balance of speed, softness, and stunning detail.


💰 3. What Affects DTG Pricing?

DTG is straightforward, but here are the key pricing factors to help you plan smart:

👕 Garment Type

DTG works best on 100% cotton or cotton-rich blends. Premium ringspun cotton provides optimal results. The garment you choose (brand, style, fabric) will influence both the print quality and overall cost.

🎨 Artwork Size & Color Coverage

The larger the design, the more ink is required. DTG prints full-color without extra setup fees — but bigger, ink-heavy prints may increase the unit price slightly.

🔁 Quantity

DTG is ideal for low to medium runs — from 1 to 100 shirts. Unlike screen printing, there are no screen setup costs, so it’s cost-efficient for small orders. Bulk discounts still apply at higher quantities.

📍 Number of Print Areas

A single front design is standard, but adding prints on the back or sleeves adds to cost. Each side is printed separately and priced accordingly.

⏱️ Turnaround Time

Our DTG production is fast — often within a few business days — but if you need an urgent order, rush production may be available depending on schedule.
