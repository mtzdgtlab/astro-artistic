📌 About Custom Embroidery

At Artistic Embroidery, we don’t just stitch — we sculpt identity into fabric. With over two decades of experience, we combine craftsmanship, cutting-edge equipment, and design expertise to deliver high-impact embroidered apparel that stands the test of time.

Embroidery is one of the most sophisticated and versatile forms of garment customization. It involves threading your logo, name, or custom design directly onto fabric, creating a durable, textured result that exudes professionalism and style. Unlike printing, which lays ink on top of a garment, embroidery becomes part of the fabric itself — resistant to fading, peeling, or cracking.

We operate a modern embroidery facility equipped with industrial multi-head machines capable of handling large-scale orders with precision. Our expert digitizers convert your artwork into a finely tuned stitch file, ensuring every detail of your design is preserved in thread. Before production begins, we provide a digital sample for your approval so there are no surprises — only satisfaction.

🧶 Embroidery Options:
	•	Flat Embroidery – Clean and classic, perfect for logos and text.
	•	3D Puff Embroidery – Adds volume and texture, ideal for caps and outerwear.
	•	Appliqué – Combines layered fabrics with stitching for bold and textured visuals.
	•	Monogramming & Name Personalization – For uniforms, gifts, and team gear.
	•	Tone-on-Tone or Metallic Threads – Elegant finishes for luxury or minimalist looks.

Whether you’re looking to outfit an entire team, give your staff a sharp uniform, or create high-end merchandise, embroidery adds lasting value to your garments.

	•	Polo shirts, oxford shirts, t-shirts
	•	Hats, caps, beanies
	•	Jackets, fleeces, hoodies
	•	Aprons, uniforms, safety vests
	•	Tote bags, backpacks, towels, robes

🎯 2. Ideal Uses — When Embroidery Is the Right Choice

Embroidery is not just decoration — it’s strategy. It’s the go-to solution when your brand or message needs to leave a powerful impression and endure long-term use. Here’s when embroidery makes the most sense:

✅ For Businesses:
	•	Corporate uniforms with logos and names
	•	Trade show apparel that stands out in a crowd
	•	Branded gifts for clients, partners, or VIPs
	•	Employee appreciation items

✅ For Teams & Schools:
	•	Sports jerseys with team logos and player names
	•	Booster club hats, jackets, and bags
	•	Graduation or school pride merchandise

✅ For Events & Organizations:
	•	Charity runs, fundraisers, or community outreach events
	•	Church groups, youth camps, clubs, and retreats
	•	Custom giveaways with premium feel

✅ For Personal Projects:
	•	Bridal party robes and keepsakes
	•	Custom gifts for birthdays, anniversaries, or holidays
	•	Family reunions, vacations, or personal branding

In short, embroidery is ideal when you want something:
	•	High-end in look and feel
	•	Durable for repeated washing or work conditions
	•	Capable of showcasing complex designs in detail
	•	Applicable on materials where printing fails (e.g., hats, heavy jackets, bags)

If you want your product to be seen, remembered, and reused, embroidery delivers.


💰 3. What Affects Embroidery Pricing?

We pride ourselves on being upfront, flexible, and competitive in our pricing — but embroidery involves several variables that influence final cost. Here’s what you need to consider:

🧥 Garment Selection

From basic to premium garments, your choice of fabric and brand affects price. Heavier or textured materials (e.g., denim, fleece) require more precision and may add to labor time. We offer a wide selection to suit your budget and quality goals.

📏 Design Complexity & Stitch Count

Embroidery pricing is largely based on stitch count, which depends on the size and detail of your logo or design. A simple name or text will cost less than an intricate multicolor emblem. Our digitizers will help optimize your design for the best look and price.

🔁 Quantity

Embroidery requires a fixed setup cost (digitizing and machine programming). The more you order, the more that cost spreads out — meaning larger quantities get better per-item pricing.

📍 Number of Embroidery Locations

Each placement — chest, back, sleeve, or hat front — involves a separate setup and stitching run. A single-location embroidery is most affordable, while multiple placements increase the cost.

⏱️ Turnaround Time

Our standard lead time is designed to keep your cost down. Rush orders can be accommodated depending on our schedule but may include expedited production fees. Let us know your deadline and we’ll work with you.
