🎯 DTF PRINTING

High-Resolution Prints with Unlimited Possibilities

📌 1. About DTF Printing

DTF (Direct to Film) printing is one of the most innovative, flexible, and high-definition printing methods available today. Unlike traditional screen printing or DTG, DTF prints your artwork onto a special film, which is then transferred onto the fabric using heat and pressure — creating vivid, full-color designs with a soft, durable finish.

At Artistic Embroidery, our DTF process combines cutting-edge equipment, top-tier inks, and expert print management to deliver photo-quality results on virtually any type of apparel — cotton, polyester, blends, and even performance fabrics. DTF excels at reproducing fine details, gradients, textures, and unlimited color variations, making it the ideal choice for complex graphics and photographic designs.

The printed transfer is applied with a heat press, bonding it firmly to the garment fibers. The result? A smooth, flexible design with excellent stretch, wash resistance, and color vibrancy — all without cracking, peeling, or fading.

⚙️ Key Features of DTF Printing:
	•	No color limits – perfect for full-color designs, gradients, and photos.
	•	Works on all fabrics – cotton, polyester, rayon, nylon, blends, spandex.
	•	Soft and breathable finish – with high elasticity and smooth texture.
	•	No weeding or vinyl cutting – everything is printed in one step.
	•	Low setup cost – ideal for small batches, test runs, or samples.

Whether you’re printing one hoodie or 100 full-color shirts, DTF offers unmatched flexibility, clarity, and turnaround speed.


🎯 2. Ideal Uses — When DTF Is the Right Choice

DTF is the perfect solution for modern apparel customization, especially when traditional methods fall short in color range or garment compatibility.

✅ For Creators & Brands:
	•	Full-color merch drops and artist collections
	•	Fashion lines with photographic or artistic prints
	•	Custom streetwear with layered or texture-rich graphics

✅ For Businesses & Events:
	•	Multicolor staff uniforms or branded shirts
	•	Promotional tees with logos, gradients, QR codes, or slogans
	•	Trade show or retail apparel needing short runs with maximum impact

✅ For Personalized Gifts & Groups:
	•	Birthday or milestone photo shirts
	•	Custom family reunion tees or bridal party gear
	•	Small-batch custom orders (1–50 pieces) without minimums

DTF shines when:
	•	Your design includes shading, gradients, or intricate detail
	•	You need short-run or one-off prints without paying for multiple screens
	•	You’re printing on dark or technical fabrics like polyester or performance wear
	•	You need a quick turnaround and don’t want to sacrifice color accuracy or feel


💰 3. What Affects DTF Printing Pricing?

DTF pricing is transparent and scalable — with low setup costs and minimal waste. Here’s what shapes the final quote:

👕 Garment Choice

We offer a wide variety of garments suitable for DTF — from cotton tees to high-end performance wear. Fabric type may influence print behavior, but we guide you to the best fit based on your design and usage.

🎨 Artwork Size & Detail

Larger or more intricate prints require more film, ink, and transfer time. Photo-realistic or highly detailed designs are welcome, but they may take longer to prepare and apply.

🔁 Quantity

Unlike screen printing, DTF doesn’t rely on color separations or setup-heavy processes — which means it’s affordable even for small orders. However, larger orders always receive better per-piece pricing.

📍 Number of Print Locations

A single front design is more affordable than multiple placements (e.g., front + sleeve + back). Additional placements are charged per transfer.

⏱️ Turnaround Time

Our standard DTF turnaround is fast — but if you need rush delivery, we’re happy to accommodate when possible. Let us know your deadline and we’ll find the best option for you.
