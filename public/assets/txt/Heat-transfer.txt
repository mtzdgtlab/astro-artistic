Fast, Flexible & Perfect for Personalization


📌 1. About Heat Transfer Printing

Heat Transfer is one of the most versatile and cost-effective garment decoration methods, offering exceptional flexibility for custom designs on a wide range of apparel. At Artistic Embroidery, our professional heat transfer process involves printing your artwork on a special transfer vinyl or film, which is then applied to the fabric using precise heat and pressure.

What sets Heat Transfer apart is its adaptability: it’s great for small batches, personalized names or numbers, multi-color graphics, and quick-turnaround orders. It delivers bold color, smooth textures, and excellent durability, especially for sportswear, uniforms, and custom items.

We use both CAD-cut vinyl (for lettering, numbers, and bold shapes) and full-color digital transfers (for photographic or complex artwork), ensuring you get the right result based on your design and garment type.

🔥 Key Features:
	•	Perfect for personalization – names, numbers, one-off designs
	•	No color limitations with digital transfers
	•	Ideal for performance wear – works great on polyester or moisture-wicking fabrics
	•	Smooth and durable finish – resistant to cracking and peeling
	•	Fast production – minimal setup and instant results

Heat Transfer is your go-to method when you need customization at speed without compromising on quality.


🎯 2. Ideal Uses — When Heat Transfer Is the Right Choice

Heat Transfer is a favorite for short-run customizations and detailed designs that need to be applied on demand or across a variety of garment types.

✅ For Sports Teams & Events:
	•	Player names and numbers on jerseys
	•	Custom gear for tournaments, races, or camps
	•	Last-minute uniform additions or replacements

✅ For Businesses & Promotions:
	•	Staff shirts with personalized roles or departments
	•	Branded apparel with bold logos or slogans
	•	Giveaway items, contests, or pop-up shop merch

	•	Personalized gifts and keepsakes

✅ For Fashion & Streetwear:
	•	On-trend statement pieces with clean vinyl finishes
	•	Artistic drops with sharp contrast and high impact

Heat Transfer shines when:
	•	You need one-off or low-quantity items
	•	You’re working with polyester or performance fabrics
	•	Your design has specific personalization (names, roles, numbers)
	•	You want a clean, smooth print with bold colors

It’s also ideal for last-minute orders, making it a top pick when time is limited but quality can’t be sacrificed.


💰 3. What Affects Heat Transfer Pricing?

Heat Transfer offers excellent value, especially for short runs and unique designs. Here’s what influences the pricing:

👕 Garment Type

We offer cotton, polyester, and blended garments at different quality and price levels. Performance fabrics often pair best with heat transfer due to their low ink absorption.

🔠 Type of Transfer
	•	Vinyl Lettering (names/numbers): lower cost and fast application
	•	Digital Transfers (logos, photos): slightly higher cost due to print prep and material

🎨 Number of Design Elements

Each name, number, or separate design counts as an individual transfer. More complexity means more press time and material usage.

🔁 Quantity

Heat Transfer has no setup fees, so it’s great for small orders. However, larger orders still benefit from better unit pricing.

📍 Placement Areas

Each placement (front, back, sleeves) is priced separately. A single front transfer is most economical.

⏱️ Urgency

Fast turnaround is a strength of heat transfer — but extremely short deadlines may include a rush fee depending on timing.
